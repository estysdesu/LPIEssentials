# Log File Archiving
## Objectives
* Create an archive named `log.tar` that is stored in the archive directory (`./archive/`).
Remove path names from the files that are archived (not possible with `tar`).
Produce verbose output while archiving.
List the contents of the archive without extracting.
Extract the files to the directory `./backup`.
