# LPIEssentials
## Description
[LPI Linux Essentials](https://www.lpi.org/our-certifications/linux-essentials-overview) exam practice on [Cisco Network Academy](https://www.netacad.com/courses/os-it/ndg-linux-essentials). There are 4 (A-D) challenge exercises at the end of the course -- those are these.  
All my notes are stored as [gists](https://gist.github.com/estysdesu), not organized by lesson though.
